# EmpowerPWD

EmpowerPWD is an inclusive job platform designed to connect Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) with employers committed to diversity and accessibility in the workplace. The system addresses employment challenges faced by PWDs by offering a supportive, accessible space where job seekers can explore tailored job opportunities and employers can showcase their inclusive practices. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 8 and 10, which focus on "Decent Work and Economic Growth" and "Reduced Inequalities," EmpowerPWD bridges the gap between capable PWD job seekers and forward-thinking employers. By fostering inclusivity, transparency, and accessibility, the platform aims to create a more equitable job market, empowering PWDs to find meaningful employment and employers to build diverse, productive teams.
